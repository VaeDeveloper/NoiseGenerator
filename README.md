## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Procedural 2D noise generation (Perlin + turbulence + marbling)
- âœ… Real-time GUI interface using ImGui with docking support
- âœ… Adjustable parameters: resolution, seed, roughness, marbling, frequency skips
- âœ… Turbulence distortion with exponential shifting and offsets
- âœ… Live preview of generated noise textures
- âœ… Export to `.png` and `.tga` formats
